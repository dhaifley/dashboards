Thank you for installing the {{ .Chart.Name }} chart.

This chart installs Grafana dashboards, as ConfigMaps, which can be used for monitoring purposes.
These dashboards will be detected automatically, when using kube-prometheus-stack.
The dashboards are intended only as a reference implementation for working with control-plane
and data-plane metrics. Users are encouraged to extend or expand upon these dashboards based
on their particular monitoring needs.

Your release "{{ .Release.Name }}" has been deployed in the "{{ .Release.Namespace }}" namespace.

To check the status of the deployment:

  helm status {{ .Release.Name }} --namespace {{ .Release.Namespace }}

To view the resources created by this chart:

  kubectl get all -n {{ .Release.Namespace }}

To uninstall the dashboards:

  helm uninstall {{ .Release.Name }} --namespace {{ .Release.Namespace }}
